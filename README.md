# IoT-based Construction worker safety monitoring system
## Description
This project showcases a Smart Worker Safety Monitoring System using IoT and AI frameworks. It is design to detect environmental hazards and worker accidents, like falling accidents in certain area, in real time using a combination of sensor fusion and computer vision. This project is proposed by a client as a part of the development of a novel monitoring system for construction firms. 

This system provides real-time notifications to safety engineers when critical events are detected such as:
- Falling incident
- Unsafe temperature or humidity levels
- High dust concentration in the air
